      <p>We decided to do a big road trip last May to the Black Hills in South Dakota. During the first leg of the trip, we decided to spend a night in Sioux Falls. I was so glad we did- it was an unexpected surprise and I hope to go back to that cute city again soon!</p>

      On our way there I talked Matt into stopping at the <a href="https://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/2127" target="_blank">Jolly Green Giant</a> in Blue Earth, MN. Since we were coming from the Twin Cities area, it didn’t really add much time to our trip and it’s been on my bucket list for a while. The Jolly Green Giant is 55.5 feet tall and has been on display since 1979. They do have a Jolly Green Giant museum, but it’s not open on the weekend so we couldn’t check it. All in all- it was a fun little stop and the perfect opportunity to stretch our legs on the road!

      We didn’t stay anywhere fancy in Sioux Falls since we were just going to spend a night. The Comfort Inn worked for us! However- when we plan another trip to that area, I’d book a hotel closer to downtown so you could more easily ditch your car and walk around.

      We throughly enjoyed walking around the downtown area. There are a lot of eclectic shops filled with everything you can imagine- antiques, books, children’s toys and more. Plus they have an awesome <a href="https://sculpturewalksiouxfalls.com" target="_blank">sculpture walk</a> throughout downtown. It changes every year so if you came back to visit again and again- you’d always be seeing something new! Summit’s favorite sculptures were a grizzly bear made out of forks and Sasquatch made out of copper wire :)

      We ate a casual dinner at the <a href="https://www.phillipsavenuediner.com" target="_blank">Phillips Ave Diner</a>, an old school diner right in the downtown area. It was the perfect place for a us to stop for a bit while exploring the downtown area. We also had some coffee at <a href="https://coffearoasterie.com" target="_blank">Coffea Roasterie and Espresso Bar</a>. Let me tell you right now— it was the BEST coffee I’ve ever had. I am a pretty steady coffee drinker so to knock it out of the park like that was amazing. I would highly recommend stopping here if you like coffee. You’ll LOVE it after you have some from Coffea!

      The next day we stopped by the falls of Sioux Falls to check it out. It was very cool with rocks over a billion years old! There was a lot to look around and see- but we didn’t stay very long since we needed to make it all the way to the Black Hills before sundown. Of course we quickly made a pitstop to check out Summit Ave for Summit. He wasn’t really having it, but Matt and I thought it was cool.

      Sioux Falls was a cool town and I can’t wait to make it back there in a few years. it’s a great city for a longer road trip, since it takes less than 4 hours to get there from the Twin Cities area. We will definitely be back!!
