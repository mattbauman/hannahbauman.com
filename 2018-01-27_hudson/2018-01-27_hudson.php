      <p>In late January we decided to drive to Hudson, Wisconsin for the <a href="http://hudsonhotairaffair.com" target="_blank">Hudson Hot Air Affair</a>. They invite A TON of hot air balloons to come to Hudson for a weekend of fun. It’s typically the first weekend in February, but they moved it up this year because of the SuperBowl. Throughout the festival, they have hot air balloon take-offs, a vendor/craft show, a parade, discounts at local businesses and more. We decided to get up early in the morning on a Saturday and drive there to see the big balloon lift off! The balloons truly depend on the weather- it can’t be too windy, in fact in has to be under 6 MPH! I was nervous we were going to drive the 45 minutes for nothing, but luckily they did take off :) I happened to be standing next to a local who told me this was the first time they’ve actually taken off in the morning in 13 years?!?! </p>

      <p>It was super fun to see all the hot air balloons take off and fly away in the distance. Let me warn you- it was COLD, which made it just a little less fun. Summit was amused but I think a little too cold to really understand the hot air balloons and the excitement around him. We stopped into the craft fair after the take-off, mostly to warm up and then headed to Keys in Hudson. We never miss an opportunity to eat at Key’s Restaurant :)</p>
      <p>I would definitely recommend the Hudson Hot Air Affair to anyone- it was fun even though it was cold! It was really a once in a lifetime experience to see all the hot air balloons taking off. I didn’t even have words for it at the time- it was completely breathtaking. We’ll definitely be back next year! Maybe it won’t be as cold ;)</p>
